      <h2>Our journey</h2>
      <p>
        After a busy journey in creating our first application, here we are,
        building something bigger and more complex. The world of technology is
        endless, and every day we learn something new.

        <h2>Our Website!!</h2>
        <p>
          The first thing we learned when we entered the GA Institute was the
          github website and the Slack application Github is my programming
          library that will accompany me throughout my endless journey in the
          world of programming As for Slack, it is a communication application
          between the student and the teacher My idea is to combine these two
          tools together to create an easy and simple means of communication
          between the student and the teacher. Of course, we will not be able to
          keep up with the features of the github site, but we will make
          communication between students and the teacher and solving and
          submitting assignments easier.
